1. My personal website consists of three main pages:
  The **main page**: aims to attract my employers by briefly showing who I am ,what I am into, and my main projects showing my abilities.
     - It consists of the intro part, which shows my name, my school, my internship experience
     - the work part, which shows five of my main projects showing my abilities from different aspects
         - Each projects should have its own page showing the whole design process, however, due to the time limitation, only the game letter city has its own site now. More will be added after.
     - the playground part, which has eight of my art pieces. I want to show how I view this world a bit through this part
  The **about page**: this page has one of my life pictures (which I really like), how I define myself as a designer, what kind of job I do (with my skills supporting me to do these jobs), and something more about me as a person
  The **resume page**: this leads to the google drive of my resume

2. The design aesthetic (visual strategy; color palette, typography)
I tried to make my website simple to emphasize the most important part I want to show to my employer. The color palette is basically black, white, blue-grey, and red.

3. The materials I used to create it (for example, the w3.css framework, templates etc.)
I used the w3.css framework, w3 template, and study from personal website in cofolios.
