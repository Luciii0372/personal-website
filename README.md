1. The goal of my site
The main page aims to attract my employers by briefly showing who I am ,what I am into, and my main projects showing my abilities. The playground page shows something I made that is interesting, but not that related to my abilities as an employee. The about page shows more about who I am. The resume page shows my resume where employer can see my experience clearly.

2. The design aesthetic (visual strategy; color palette, typography)
I tried to make my website simple to emphasize the most important part I want to show to my employer. The color palette is basically black, white, and red.

3. The materials you used to create it (for example, the w3.css framework, templates etc.
I used the w3.css framework, w3 template, and study from personal website in coportfolios.
